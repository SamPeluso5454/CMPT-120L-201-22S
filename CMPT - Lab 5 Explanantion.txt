Lab Five


1. I chose to input constant variables to signify the customer's preferred deposit ratio of 85% for checking & 15% for savings for both their respective accounts. I labeled these variables “CHECKING_RATIO” & “SAVINGS_RATIO” in all caps to inform the interpreter of the constant of these variables. 


2. I chose to separate the debits and credits transactions to allow for the proper functionality of “if functions”. 
 
3. I wrote the “if functions” to handle the totality of the Saturday transactions by delegating the sum of the transactions into proper checking and savings accounts. 


I prioritized congregating magic numbers to coincide with appropriate labels and functions. I also tried to diminish the total length of the function by combining similar transaction types and structures.
